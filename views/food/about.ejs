        The name of this app was inspired by a fruit found in Brazil's storied Northeast. Although not the most pleasant fruit when eaten raw, a little ingenuity is all it takes to make this one of the most interesting, delicious, and beautiful fruits of the world. The purpose of this app is to inspire you to use that same ingenuity in cataloguing your favorite foods, dishes, ingredients, and recipes, and to craft mealplans around your new discoveries.
