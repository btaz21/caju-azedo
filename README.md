# Caju App

==================================

## Description
The name of this app was inspired by a fruit found in the tropical climes of Northeastern Brazil. Although not the most pleasant fruit when eaten raw, a little human ingenuity is all it takes to make this one of the most interesting, delicious, and beautiful fruits of the world. The purpose of this app is to inspire you to use that same ingenuity in cataloguing your favorite foods, dishes, ingredients, and recipes, and to craft mealplans around your new discoveries.

This app allows you to:

1. Create a user profile with all the functionality of the app included and unique to each user.
2. Add dishes that you've eaten or want to eat replete with an image, description, recipe link, and other details.
3. Edit and/or delete your dishes
4. Add mealplans based on your dishes
5. Edit and/or delete your mealplans

## Technologies Used
Full-stack, CRUD app built on Node.JS and MongoDB. and using Express as a ....using Javascript, HTML, CSS, Mongo, Mongoose, Heroku, Atlas

## Unsolved Problems
1. One of the biggest issues I had was using mongoose to manipulate the data when its heavily nested within the dataset. One workaround is to pull the whole dataset out, manipulate it with javascript, and then perform a doc.save(). This doesn't seem to work every time, however.
